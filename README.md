This is my attempt at reproducing an existing website. By the end of this task I should understand more about developer tools and have a much better ability to utilize html and CSS in practice.
Some objectives - I should be able to do the following:
Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
